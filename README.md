# TeaCNV: Tumor Epigenomic Absolute Copy Number Variation


## Description
TeaCNV is a computational framework designed to estimate tumor absolute copy number variations from epigenomics data by aggregating the sparse signal of multi-individual cells to cell populations.
TeaCNV allows the inference of absolute copy number profiles from low coverage sparse data, including single-cell ATAC-seq and Multiome-seq data. 

## System requirements and dependency
This framework runs on R (version > 4.2.0)
